# Design boilerplate

## Features

 - Superfast live reload
 - Dynamic component imports
 - Sass compilation, autoprefixing, minification and linting
 - Mildly-opinionated CSS structure
 - JS module bundling, optimisation and linting
 - 'Easy' JS usage (you don't _have_ to use ES6, modules, etc)

 - Image optimisation
